## ML classification exercise
In preparation for a research project, I used the *Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset* to practice training ML models for classification.
The nature of this dataset is quite close to that of I was working with:
- the number of instances is in the same range and the ratio of malignant and benign cases represent the bias that is typical of real life scenarios
- primarily, binary classification was used to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous cases in our study as well
- the relatively high number of features gave me the opportunity to perform feature selection and validate its effects on training ML models
