## Classification_exercise
In preparation for an upcuming research project, I used the *Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset* to practice training ML models for classification.
The nature of this dataset is quite close to that of I will be working with:
- the number of instances is in the same range and the ratio of malignant and benign cases represent the bias that is typical of real life scenarios
- primarily, binary classification will be used to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous cases in our study as well
- the relatively high number of features gives me the opportunity to perform feature selection and validate its effects on training ML models
